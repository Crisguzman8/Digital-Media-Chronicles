<h2> About Me </h2>
<script src="digital chronicles/script.js"></script>
<p> My name is Crismary, it was chosen by my mom and my aunt, they chose this name to name me after my mom as her name is Maria Cristina so they named me Cris (for Cristina) and Mary (for Maria). I was almost named Lismary but my aunt said that she didn't like the name and that it would not suit me so they both worked on creating a name for me and they came up with Crismary instead. My favorite thing to do is travel. I love it when I travel to the Dominican Republic during summer and I get to visit family and enjoy the beaches and beautiful areas of the country. Back in New York, my second home, I like to hang out with my friends and go out to new places. Overall, I am a person who loves to go out and hates to stay inside all day doing nothing. I would always rather explore something new than stay at home and do nothing.<p></p>

 <li>My favorite hobby is doing nails and hair</li>

<h2> Digital Media Class So Far: </h2>
<p>In this class, students might explore areas like graphic design, video production, social media strategies, web design, and interactive media. The focus is on understanding both the technical skills and creative principles needed to craft engaging digital content. Students would often work with various software tools for editing photos, videos, and audio. Itâ€™s a mix of creativity and technical expertise, and it prepares students for careers in fields like advertising, filmmaking, online content creation, and digital marketing.</p>
